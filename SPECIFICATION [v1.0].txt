# DMDice
 Dungeon Master Dice Roller

The main function to be absorbed Tony created. It is accessed by URL and returns an array of data on each dice requested. As if the player
had "rolled" x number of die.

This is a strawman prototype to be modified with agreement with Tony on the func parms and return dataset(s).

	DMDice(smallint D6, smallint D8, smallint D10, smallint D12) RETURNS Array(?)

		D6  = # of six-sided dice to roll 
		D8  = # of eight-sided dice to roll 
		D10 = # of ten-sided dice to roll 
		D12 = # of twelve-sided dice to roll

			asks the DM to roll (4) 6-sided, (3) 8-sided, (2) 10-sided and (1) 12-sided Dice
